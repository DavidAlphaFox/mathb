Title: About MathB.in
Name: 

[MathB.in](1) is a website meant for sharing snippets of
mathematical text with others on the web. This is a pastebin for
mathematics. This website was born out of a one night hack on
Sunday, March 25, 2012. It was initially written in PHP and then
later rewritten in Common Lisp. The source code of MathB.in is
available at <https://github.com/susam/mathb>.


Posting and Sharing
-------------------

A new post can be composed by visiting the [home page](/) and
writing or pasting code in the box on the left hand pane of the
page. Once a post is composed and submitted, the page is saved
and it becomes accessible with a new unique URL. The new page
looks similar to this page and it has a unique URL of its own.
The URL can be shared with anyone on the web and they will be
able to visit your post.


Post Format
-----------

A post can be composed in a mixture of LaTeX and Markdown text.
For a demonstration on how LaTeX and Markdown is rendered, see
the [demo page](1). To quickly get started with posting
mathematical snippets, see the [tutorial](2).

The main content of each post can have a maximum of 10,000
characters. The optional title field and name field can have a
maximum of 120 characters each.


Usage
-----

This website is meant for creating mathematical snippets.
Science and technical posts are also welcome on this website.
Any other type of post should not be posted to this website. Any
post that is not mathematical, scientific, or technical in
nature will be removed.
