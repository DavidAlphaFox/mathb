Title: About MathB.in
Name: 

[MathB.in](1) is a website meant for sharing snippets of
mathematical text with others on the web. This is a pastebin for
mathematics. This website was born out of a one night hack on
Sunday, March 25, 2012.


Posting and sharing
-------------------

A new post can be composed by visiting the [home page][1] and
writing or pasting code in the box on the left hand pane of the
page. Once a post is composed and submitted, the page is saved
and it becomes accessible with a new unique URL. The new page
looks similar to this page and it has a unique URL of its own.
The URL can be shared with anyone on the web and they will be
able to visit your post.


Code
----

The post can be composed in a mixture of LaTeX and Markdown
text. For a demonstration on how LaTeX and Markdown is rendered,
see the [demo page](1). To quickly get started with posting
mathematical snippets, see the [tutorial](2).
