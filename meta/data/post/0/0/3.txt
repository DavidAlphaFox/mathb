Title: About MathB.in
Name: 

[MathB.in] is a website meant for sharing snippets
of mathematical text with others on the web. This
is a pastebin for mathematics. The source code of
MathB.in is available at
<https://github.com/susam/mathb>.

Posting and Sharing
-------------------

A new post can be composed by visiting the [home
page](/) and writing or pasting code in the box on
the left hand pane of the page. Once a post is
composed and submitted, the page is saved and it
becomes accessible with a new unique URL. The new
page looks similar to this page and it has a
unique URL of its own. The URL can be shared with
anyone on the web and they will be able to visit
your post.


Post Format
-----------

A post can be composed in a mixture of LaTeX and
Markdown text. For a demonstration of how LaTeX
and Markdown is rendered, see the [demo page](1).
To quickly get started with posting mathematical
snippets, see the [tutorial](2).


Usage
-----

This website is meant for creating mathematical
snippets. Science and technical posts are also
welcome on this website. Any other type of post
should not be posted to this website. Any post
that is not mathematical, scientific, or technical
in nature will be removed.


History
-------

[MathB.in] is the oldest mathematics pastebin that
is still online and serving its community of
users. It isn't the first mathematics pastebin
though. It's the second. The first pastebin was
written by Mark A. Stratman. It was hosted at the
domain *mathbin.net* until 2020.

MathB.in was born on Sunday, 25 March 2012, after
a single night of furious coding. This was a
result of stumbling upon [math.stackexchange.com]
the previous night which used MathJax to render
mathematics formula on the web browser. Thanks to
that chance encounter with MathJax, the rest of
the Saturday night was spent in coding a new
mathematics pastebin using MathJax and PHP. After
coding all through the night, registering a new
domain name, and setting up a website, [MathB.in]
was released early Sunday morning.

The current version of MathB.in no longer runs on
PHP. It has been rewritten in Common Lisp since
then. See the blog post [MathB.in Turns 10] for
more details about the history of MathB.in.
